Below is a terminal session transcript to run this clojure app.


```
> clj -m xmltosql.core
Greetings, Earthlings
```

#### Todo

- + create minimal directory structure
- + create minimal xml
- + create core.clj where -main function lives
- + create a deps.edn with some useful dependencies
- consider moving data into resources, in case we want to later have data in an uberjar
- need a file for SQL source
- will need an SQL dep, probably HugSQL is best
